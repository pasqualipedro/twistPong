# . concept

The request was to develop a simple game to run on any browser. It was our first project as a WebDev.
The main objective, was to make it conceptually simple, easy to play, recognizable across different ages and highly flexible for future improvements and interpretations of my own.

## . what it is?

Twist Pong is a game that needs two players. It runs on any browser and it was intended to be played by anyone, at different ages, since it is very straight forward and simply fun.

## . how to play?
**[https://pasqualipedro.github.io/twistPong/](https://pasqualipedro.github.io/twistPong/)**

At the moment, all you need to do is choose a side at the battle field.
Pick the left side and you will have the Orange player.
Or the right side, and you will have the Blue player.
Orange player move with W(up), S(down).
Blue player move with O(up), L(down).

## . 2nd round?

After a Game Over, press start and play again.
